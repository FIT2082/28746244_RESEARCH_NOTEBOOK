## Week 10
Over the midsemester break and throughout some of this week, I worked on the R script to display each instance as well as all models associated.
As you can see below, we have a lot of informative graphs per instance:

Therefore allowing us to make informed decisions about which models are performing best

The aim for next week is to decide on some poster layout, and start filling it with info, and to run more tests so we have more graphs to base our decision off of.
