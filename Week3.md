# Week 3

After having goals set for last week, we aimed to:

- [X] Have SCIP downloaded, as well as an introduction to C 
- [X] A working linux environment, knowledge of Make and general linux commands
- [X] A git repo, where we can edit SCIP files for testing

Although we found out this week that we had the wrong version of SCIP downloaded.

## Goals
The goals for next week's meeting is to:

* Reinstall the correct SCIP, and update the github
* Look at the files branch_relpscost.c for psuedocost update files
