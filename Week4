# Week 4

Because of the project specification, we were only able to install a new version of SCIP and update the git.

- [X] Reinstall the correct SCIP, and update the github
- [ ] Look at the files branch_relpscost.c for psuedocost update files

## Goals

So the aim for next week is to continue looking at branch_relpscost.c
