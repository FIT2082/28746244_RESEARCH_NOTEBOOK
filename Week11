## Week 11
Now that Week 12 is looming near, we've sorted out a poster design, and are in talks with Pierre and Edward about what content should/should not be on the poster.
While our first edit had lots of text, between now and week 12 we aim to finish all the required content and use more diagrams, and have more concise explanations.

We also ran about 30 test instances, sadly all of which put SCIP's estimate above ours.
After the week 12 meeting we aim to try training models on only data which pertains to the same variable, and see if this gives us better results.

The aim for next week is to complete the poster and rehearse the 2 minute poster pitch.
